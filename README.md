So, you want to learn something about computers, perhaps a bit about programming, and maybe how computers work. By this point you already have some idea of what you can do with a computer, but a lot of it may seem like magic to you. As cool as it would be, there is no magic here, just many levels of abstraction, so lets dive deeper down to some of the lower levels and learn some new things.

## A box of your own
You all have computers, but not all computers are built the same. Computers are built in different shapes, styles, colors, and come loaded with different software. We want to have everyone all in the same environment so we can all learn together, and have access to the same tools. We also want to be able to do just about anything along the way without putting our computers at risk when we make a mistake.

You are all going to install a [Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)(Virtual Machine Wikipedia entry, I will refer to Virtual Machine as VM from here on). Specifically, you are going to run an **Ubuntu 16.04** virtual machine. [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) is a popular "flavor" of Linux with a very strong community which makes it a nice operating system to use as an introduction to Linux.

However, since part of the goal here is to give all of you a small degree of fluency with the *Command Line*, we are going to run a so-called "headless" VM.
